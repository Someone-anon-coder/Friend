Who are you building this for? The app is built for lonely, introvert people.

Why are you building this? So that people can have a friend to share their thoughts with, talk about meaningless things, and have someone to share their feelings with. 
    It's a virtual friend that can be there for them when they need someone to talk to.

What is UVP: The UVP is that the AI in this app will not be your overfriendly, selfless and always helping AI. Users can experience the realistic friend progression.
    Starting as strangers to being best friends, the AI will have its own thoughts, feelings, and emotions. 
    It will have its own interests, hobbies, and preferences. 
    It will have its own flaws and imperfections. 
    The AI will not be perfect, and it will make mistakes.
    The AI will be designed in a way to simulate human-like memory. Remembering important things according to context and its own reasons.
    The AI will have its own background, how it met you, and how it came in your life. (At first these will be limited. Maybe changed later to have users create their own scenarios)

This will not be game like, not have levels to clear and AI memory, presonality will be mystery. It's not a game, it't a virtual friend.
